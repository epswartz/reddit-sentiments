# reddit-sentiments

Eventually, this will be a web-app where you put in a reddit username and some query, and it will list out the reddit user's comments which involve that query and how they feel about it, using IBM Watson's sentiment analysis.

For now, it's just another project abandoned in its infancy. :'(
